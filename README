Welcome to my Arch Install Script.  It is meant to be used after the regular archinstall from the ISO and selecting the minimal CLI only install.

It adds various programs that I use and think that most people should use and allows you to select a Desktop Environment or Window Manager of your choice and pulls down the needed config files.

It if free to modify, use, whatever.  I mainly made this for my personal use but others might find it better in some ways then the archinstall as it will do more things and set some things up.

I do not take any responcibility for any things that could go wrong by using this script, it is a script and should be looked over before use.

Added The Following Desktop Environments and Window Managers:

01. Gnome
02. Cinnamon
